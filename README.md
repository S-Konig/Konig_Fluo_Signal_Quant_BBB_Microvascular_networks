# Konig_Fluo_Signal_Quant_BBB_Microvascular_networks
This repository provides scripts written in the ImageJ macro language for quantitative analysis of fluorescence intensity within microvascular networks. The macros enable location-dependent measurements, allowing users to compare fluorescence signals in vascular versus non-vascular regions.
